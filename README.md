# M9-ReadMe-Generator

## Description
Using node.js, this code can be locally run. This code will prompt a user to answer a few questions and generate a new ReadMe File called "README1". This is a part of the Module 9 Challenge for the Ohio State University Coding Bootcamp.

## Usage 
- Ensure node js and inquirer are installed


## Contributors
I had a tutor session on 3/25 with Janvier Mbilizi. He helped me write out the license related functions, told me to break out my questions variable from inquirer prompt, and helped me confirm I was calling the functions in the correct order.
